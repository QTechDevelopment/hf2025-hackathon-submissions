## Technical Architecture

### Components

1. **Extension Frontend** (`popup/`)
   - User interface for prompts and email management
   - OAuth authentication flow
   - Gmail API integration

2. **Content Script** (`scripts/content.js`)
   - Runs on Gmail pages
   - Provides floating action button
   - Highlights emails in preview mode

3. **Background Service Worker** (`scripts/background.js`)
   - Manages authentication state
   - Handles message passing
   - Performs email actions via Gmail API

4. **Appwrite Function** (`appwrite-functions/gemini-analyzer/`)
   - Receives emails and user prompt
   - Calls Gemini AI for analysis
   - Returns matched emails and recommended actions
   - Stores analysis history

### Data Flow

```
User Input ‚Üí Extension ‚Üí Gmail API (fetch emails)
                    ‚Üì
            Appwrite Function ‚Üí Gemini AI (analyze)
                    ‚Üì
            Extension ‚Üê Analysis Results
                    ‚Üì
            Gmail API (perform actions)
```

## Privacy & Security

- **No Data Storage**: Emails are never stored, only analyzed in real-time
- **OAuth Security**: Uses Google's secure OAuth 2.0 for authentication
- **User Control**: All actions require explicit user confirmation
- **Appwrite Security**: All API calls are authenticated and rate-limited
- **Open Source**: Full source code available for review

**Analysis doesn't work**
- Verify Gemini API key is set in Appwrite Function
- Check Appwrite Function logs for errors
- Ensure function has proper permissions

**Emails not being deleted**
- Check that Gmail API scope includes `gmail.modify`
- Verify OAuth token is valid
- Check browser console for API errors
