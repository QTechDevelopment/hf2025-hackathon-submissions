## Project Description    
AI Email Cleaner Browser Extension is a browser extension that helps users clean up their email inbox intelligently using AI-powered prompts. The extension analyzes emails and organizes, filters, or deletes them based on custom user prompts, making email management effortless and efficient.

<!--
The project I created is an AI-powered browser extension that revolutionizes email management by allowing users to clean up their inbox using natural language prompts. Users can tell the extension what kind of emails to keep, archive, or delete, and the AI handles the rest automatically.
-->

## Inspiration behind the Project  
Email overload is a universal problem that affects productivity and mental well-being. Traditional email filters are rigid and require manual setup for each rule. This project was inspired by the need for a smarter, more flexible solution that understands context and user intent through natural language, making email management as simple as having a conversation.

<!--
The reason I chose this idea/project was to solve the daily struggle of managing overflowing email inboxes. I wanted to leverage AI to make email cleanup intuitive and conversational, allowing users to simply describe what they want rather than configuring complex rules.
-->
